# First, search files recursively for text using ag (SilverSearcher). This could be refactored to use grep probably

# Lines.txt will contain the file paths, line numbers, and line contents like so: (one entry per line)
# index.js:52:            handler: function onNext() {
# Now, using your favorite editor, edit the lines.txt file with any changes you want to make to those lines (using something search replace, a text editor, or a bash script)
# Save the file and now run the script again to update all the files accordingly:
# refactor run lines.txt

# Note: You can also use `refactor dry lines.txt` to show the changes that will be made
# Note2: Make sure that you run the script from the same directory and that you don't make line-numbering changes between gen and run
